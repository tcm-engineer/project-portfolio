						</header>

						<p><strong style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;">The Challenge</strong></br>
							The portable distance meter, shown below, was the winning design in the 2018 University of Southampton
							2nd year Electronic Engineering Group System Design Challenge sponsored by BAE Systems.
							The challenge was to build a portable electronic high precision measuring device within 4 weeks.
							There were 13 teams, each comprised of 6 people.</p>

						<p style="margin-top: -3rem;"><strong style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;">System Design</strong></br>
							<strong>Technology Stack</strong></br>
							To create the software running on embedded Linux on Raspberry Pi we used Python 3.7 and the PyQt5
							framework. Another proposed pairing was C++ and Qt5. We chose the first option because it allowed us to be
							more productive in terms of implementing designed architecture, creating the graphical user interface,
							communicating with the mobile application and interfacing with the operating system.</br></br>						

							<strong>System Architecture</strong></br>
							We decided that the program is going to be multithreaded, to allow independent working of the user interface,
							hardware control and handling requests from mobile app at the same time. We used QThreads from the PyQt5
							library. The main thread was running the GUI and engine, which was responsible for dataflow in the system.
							The second thread was a hardware control and data processing unit, and the last one was responsible for
							communication with the mobile app. To communicate between threads, we used PyQt5’s signal and slot mechanisms.</br></br>

							<strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></br>
							The GUI was divided into five different tabs - one for settings, two for data display and two control panels.
							Each of them presented user with different options such as moving motors, taking measurements and
							mapping the room. The user could also view all measurements and maps taken since start of the session -
							additional information such as a timestamp and uncertainty of the measurement are provided.</br></br>

							<strong>Updater</strong></br>
							In the code there is a simple updater implemented. It requires an access to Wi-Fi which can be obtained by usage
							of the virtual keyboard on the touchscreen. Once updater is launched from the GUI, it pulls the most recent
							version of the software from GitHub and restarts the program.</br></br>

							<strong>Hardware Modules</strong></br>
							<ul style="margin-top: -1.5rem; padding-left: 2rem; ">
								<li>Raspberry Pi 3 and Touchscreen</li>
								<li>Seeedstudio LIDAR Module</li>
								<li>Stepper Motor and Driver</li>
								<li>Laser Circuit</li>
								<li>Power Management</li>
							</ul>
							
							<strong>Raspberry Pi 3 and Touch Screen</strong></br>
							We decided to go for the Raspberry Pi 3 and a compatible touchscreen for our project as from the outset we
							realised we had a team that was stronger with programming than with hardware. Using a Pi and touchscreen
							would help us to reduce the number of circuits needed to be built as we would not need extra peripheral
							hardware such as buttons to interface with the GUI. Furthermore, by using a Pi we could easily implement
							Bluetooth connectivity with the device.</br></br>

							<strong>Seeedstudio LIDAR Module</strong></br>
							We needed a laser to be able to show where the system was pointing. We decided to go for the Seeedstudio
							LIDAR module for our main sensor as it has a high precision: 1% error between 0.3-6m and 2% error from 6-
							12m</br></br>

							<strong>Stepper Motor and Driver</strong></br>
							We went for a stepper motor and a driver chip capable of microstepping over a servo motor as we wanted the
							increased accuracy and higher torque that one can get from a microstepped stepper motor over a servo.
							Furthermore, for the room scan functionality we needed a 360° range of motion which is harder to find with a
							servo.</br></br>

							<strong>Laser Circuit</strong></br>
							The laser pointer acts as a reference to mark what the point the device is measuring, therefore it must be placed
							as close to the lidar sensor and in parallel to its line of sight. Adding a laser increases the ease of use of the
							device by allowing the user to know exactly what point is being measured. This sub-system will output a clear
							visible light dot, with limited light spreading and low intensity.</br></br>
							
							<strong>Power Management</strong></br>
							To power the Pi, we needed a 5v micro USB connection. We also needed a second power source of 2.8V to
							power the motor. We decided to go for a power bank for our power source over battery cells as it is
							rechargeable, has the required voltage for the Pi and can be easily stepped down to 2.8V using a voltage
							regulator.</br></br>

						<p style="margin-top: -3rem;"><strong style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;">My Contribution</strong></br>
							For this project, my tasks involved the hardware research, design, simulation, manufacturing and testing. The
							areas of the device I contributed to be the laser pointer sub-system, the stepping motor sub-system, and the stepdown
							voltage converter. I was originally tasked to design, build and test the laser pointer sub-system and the
							step-down voltage converter. Once my tasks were completed, I assisted in building and testing of the stepping
							motor sub-system along with testing of the Lidar. Furthermore, I interfaced the step-down voltage converter
							with the stepping motor board and the power-bank and interfaced the laser pointer with the raspberry pi. Once
							the sub-system interfacing tests were complete, I soldered components for the step-down voltage converter and
							the stepping motor board onto Veroboard.
